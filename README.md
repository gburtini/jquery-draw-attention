# jQuery.drawAttention.js

## Instructions
1. call $.drawAttention() to start a highlighting context
2. call $("selector").drawAttention("add"); to add to the highlighted elements
3. call $("selector").drawAttention("remove"); to remove from the highlighted elements
4. call $.drawAttention("destroy"); to destroy the highlighting context and return to the regular page

## Parameters

The constructor ($.drawAttention) can take an object of parameters. Currently, these are, by default:

```javascript
color: 'black',	// the color of the shade
opacity: '0.6',	// the opacity of the shade
shade: 'shade',	// the name of the shade

// the additional style to apply to the highlighted elements
style: "-moz-box-shadow: 0 0 11px #FFF;
	-webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 11px #FFF;
	box-shadow: 0 0 11px #FFF;"
```

## Screenshot

Here I have selected some arbitrary elements (the headers in the left column and the listing for the game "Off-balance") to be highlighted while everything else remains under a 60% opacity shade.

## Known Issues
* uses z-index to move elements above the shade
* uses pointer-events to allow clicks to pass through the shade (may not be desired and has poor support: http://caniuse.com/pointer-events)
* transparent elements "pull up" their background color above the shade -- this may not be desirable if: 
  * 1. the background color is "close" to the shade color
  * 2. the background is actually an image (may just be lost).
* - transparency is detected with rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) which is probably not the ideal way to do it.
